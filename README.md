Python Expression Evaluator
The Python Expression Evaluator is a Python-based program that can execute simple arithmetic expressions and variable assignments.

To run the Expression Evaluator, you'll need to have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download the latest version of Python from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you have Python installed, you can run the Expression Evaluator by executing the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

python evaluator.py
This will start the Expression Evaluator and you can begin entering your programs.

Example Programs
Here are some example programs that you can run using the Expression Evaluator:

Simple Arithmetic Operations:
a = 10
b = 20
c = a + b
print(c)
Output: 30

Nested Expressions:
x = 5
y = 3
z = (x + y) * 2
print(z)
Output: 16

Division by Zero:

a = 10
b = 0
c = a / b
print(c)
Output: Division by zero

Variable Not Defined:
x = a + 5
print(x)
Output: Variable 'a' is not defined

Syntax Error:
x = 10
y = 20
z = x + y *
print(z)
Output: Unexpected token: ')'

To run these example programs, simply copy the code and paste it into the Expression Evaluator when prompted.

LIMITATIONS
The current version of the Expression Evaluator has the following limitations:
Only supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
Does not support functions, loops, or conditional statements.
Does not support user input or interactive features.
FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS
Future improvements to the Expression Evaluator may include:

Support for more advanced arithmetic operations, such as exponents and modulo.
Addition of functions, loops, and conditional statements.
Support for user input and interactive features.
Improved error handling and reporting.
